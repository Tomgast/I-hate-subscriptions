# New Pricing Model Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a new three-tier pricing model for CashControl:

1. **Monthly Subscription**: €3/month - Full access to all Pro features
2. **Yearly Subscription**: €25/year - Full access with 31% savings
3. **One-Time Scan**: €25 - Bank scan + export + 1 year of reminder access

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes

#### StripeService Updates (`includes/stripe_service.php`)
- ✅ Updated `createCheckoutSession()` to support three plan types
- ✅ Added `upgradeUserToSubscription()` for monthly/yearly subscriptions
- ✅ Added `upgradeUserToOneTimeScan()` for one-time scan purchases
- ✅ Updated `recordPayment()` to track plan types
- ✅ Enhanced `hasProAccess()` to handle different access levels
- ✅ Added `hasReminderAccess()` for reminder-specific access control
- ✅ Added `getUserSubscriptionDetails()` for comprehensive user status

#### Database Schema Changes
New columns added to support pricing model:

**Users Table:**
- `subscription_type` ENUM('monthly', 'yearly', 'one_time_scan')
- `subscription_status` ENUM('active', 'cancelled', 'expired')
- `has_scan_access` BOOLEAN
- `scan_access_type` ENUM('one_time', 'subscription')
- `reminder_access_expires_at` DATETIME

**Checkout Sessions Table:**
- `plan_type` ENUM('monthly', 'yearly', 'one_time_scan')

**Payment History Table:**
- `plan_type` ENUM('monthly', 'yearly', 'one_time_scan')

**New Table: subscription_history**
- Tracks subscription changes and renewals
- Links to Stripe subscription IDs
- Records subscription lifecycle events

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### Upgrade Page (`upgrade.php`)
- ✅ Replaced single pricing card with three-tier pricing display
- ✅ Added plan selection buttons for each tier
- ✅ Updated JavaScript to pass plan type to checkout

#### Checkout Page (`payment/checkout.php`)
- ✅ Added plan type parameter handling
- ✅ Dynamic pricing display based on selected plan
- ✅ Updated Stripe session creation with plan type

### 3. Access Control Logic

#### Subscription Access Levels:
- **Monthly/Yearly Subscribers**: Full access to all features
- **One-Time Scan Users**: Bank scan + export + 1 year of reminders
- **Free Users**: Manual subscription tracking only

#### Reminder Access:
- **Active Subscribers**: Unlimited reminder access
- **One-Time Scan**: 1 year of reminder access from purchase date
- **Expired Users**: No reminder access

### 4. Migration & Testing

#### Database Migration (`admin/migrate-pricing.php`)
- ✅ Web-based migration interface
- ✅ Safely adds new columns and tables
- ✅ Migrates existing premium users to one-time scan model
- ✅ Provides migration statistics

#### Test Suite (`test/test-pricing-model.php`)
- ✅ Tests Stripe configuration
- ✅ Validates database schema
- ✅ Tests access control logic
- ✅ Simulates all upgrade paths
- ✅ Verifies payment recording

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration
Visit: `https://123cashcontrol.com/admin/migrate-pricing.php`
- Click "Run Migration" to update database schema
- Verify migration completed successfully

### 2. Test Implementation
Visit: `https://123cashcontrol.com/test/test-pricing-model.php`
- Run comprehensive test suite
- Verify all tests pass

### 3. Update Stripe Configuration
Ensure your `secure-config.php` contains:
```php
'STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY' => 'YOUR_STRIPE_LIVE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY',
'STRIPE_SECRET_KEY' => 'YOUR_STRIPE_LIVE_SECRET_KEY',
'STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET' => 'whsec_...',
```

### 4. Test Payment Flows
1. **Monthly Subscription**: Visit `/upgrade.php` → Choose Monthly → Complete checkout
2. **Yearly Subscription**: Visit `/upgrade.php` → Choose Yearly → Complete checkout  
3. **One-Time Scan**: Visit `/upgrade.php` → Choose One-Time Scan → Complete checkout

## Stripe Integration

### Payment Modes:
- **Monthly/Yearly**: Uses Stripe Subscriptions (`mode: 'subscription'`)
- **One-Time Scan**: Uses Stripe Payments (`mode: 'payment'`)

### Metadata Tracking:
All Stripe sessions include:
- `user_id`: CashControl user ID
- `plan_type`: Selected plan (monthly/yearly/one_time_scan)

### Webhook Handling:
The existing webhook handler will automatically:
- Process successful payments
- Update user access levels
- Send confirmation emails
- Record payment history

## User Experience

### Upgrade Flow:
1. User visits `/upgrade.php`
2. Sees three pricing options with clear benefits
3. Clicks desired plan button
4. Redirected to `/payment/checkout.php?plan=PLAN_TYPE`
5. Reviews plan details and pricing
6. Completes Stripe checkout
7. Redirected to success page with access activated

### Access Management:
- **Dashboard**: Shows current subscription status
- **Settings**: Displays plan details and expiration dates
- **Features**: Automatically enabled/disabled based on access level

## Backward Compatibility

### Existing Users:
- All existing premium users migrated to "one-time scan" model
- Receive 1 year of reminder access from migration date
- No disruption to current functionality

### Legacy Code:
- Old `is_premium` checks still work
- Gradual migration to new access control methods
- No breaking changes to existing features

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track:
- Conversion rates by plan type
- Monthly vs yearly subscription preferences
- One-time scan usage patterns
- Reminder access utilization
- Churn rates by subscription type

### Database Queries:
```sql
-- Active subscribers by type
SELECT subscription_type, COUNT(*) 
FROM users 
WHERE subscription_status = 'active' 
GROUP BY subscription_type;

-- Revenue by plan type (last 30 days)
SELECT plan_type, SUM(amount) as revenue
FROM payment_history 
WHERE payment_date >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
GROUP BY plan_type;

-- One-time scan reminder access expiring soon
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM users 
WHERE has_scan_access = 1 
AND reminder_access_expires_at BETWEEN NOW() AND DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY);
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Changes**: Upload all modified files to production
2. **Run Migration**: Execute database migration via web interface
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify all payment flows work correctly
4. **Monitor Metrics**: Track conversion rates and user behavior
5. **Optimize Pricing**: Adjust based on user feedback and analytics

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **Migration Fails**: Check database permissions and connection
- **Stripe Errors**: Verify API keys and webhook configuration
- **Access Issues**: Check user subscription status in database

### Debug Tools:
- `/test/test-pricing-model.php` - Comprehensive testing
- `/admin/migrate-pricing.php` - Migration status and statistics
- Browser developer tools - Frontend debugging
